<p><pre><b>(Chorus)</b>
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before
O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

<b><i>(Chorus)</i></b>

You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

<b><i>(Chorus x2)</i></b>

Jesus, I'll worship Your holy name
Lord, I'll worship Your holy name

Sing like never before
O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

That You my king would die for me?

<div class = "song" id = "And Can it be">
<h3>5. And Can it be</h3><p><pre>
And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me?

<b>Refrain:</b>
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me!

'Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine!
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race;
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th'eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

Even though You are a King.
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything. <i> [Refrain]</i>

Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye. <i> [Refrain]</i>

<h3>7. Be Thou My Vision</h3> <p> By Eleanor Hull</p>
<p><pre>
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;
Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;
Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

High King of Heaven, my victory won,
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!

Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

<div class = "song" id = "Before the Throne">
<h3>8. Before the Throne</h3><p><pre>
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong , a pefect plea:
A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

My name is graven on his hands,
My name is written on his heart;
I know that while in heaven he stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look, and see him there 
Who made an end of all my sin.

Because a sinless Saviour died ,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God , the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  Praise the One, 
Risen Song of God!

<h3>10. Blessed Be Your Name</h3> <p> By Matt Redman , Beth Redman</p>
<p><pre>
Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful 
Where Your streams of abundance flow 
Blessed be Your name 
And blessed be Your name when I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness 
Blessed be your name 

Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise 
And when the darkness closes in Lord 
Still I will say 

Blessed be the name of the Lord 
Blessed be Your name 
Blessed be the name of the Lord 
Blessed be Your glorious name 

Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me 
When the world's “all as it should be” 
Blessed be Your name 
And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering 
Though there's pain in the offering 
Blessed be Your name 

You give and take away 
You give and take away 
My heart will choose to say 
Lord, blessed be Your name

<h3>11. Blessed be the tie that binds</h3> <p> By  Johann Hans Georg Nägeli , John Fawcett</p>
<p><pre>
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father’s throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts, and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

Spirit breathe on me

Breathe on me breath of God
Burn bright eternal fire

You are my one desire

<h3>13. Christ is Risen</h3> <p> By Matt Maher</p>
<p><pre>
Let no one caught in sin remain
Inside the lie of inward shame
But fix our eyes upon the cross
And run to Him who showed great love
And bled for us
Freely You've bled for us

<b>Chorus:</b>
Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave

Beneath the weight of all our sin
You bowed to none but heaven's will
No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
No burden great can hold You down
In strength You reign
Forever let Your church proclaim

<b><i>(Chorus)</i></b>

O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
The glory of God has defeated the night

O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
Our God is not dead
He's alive! He's alive!

<b><i>(Chorus 2x)</i></b>

Rise up from the grave

<h3>14. Cornerstone</h3> <p> By Hillsong</p>
<p><pre>
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus' Name

Christ alone
Cornerstone 
Weak made strong 
In the Savior's love

I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne

<h3>15. Count Your Blessings</h3> <p> By Johnson Oatman, Jr.</p>
<p><pre>
<b>Verse 1</b>
When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed
When you are discouraged
Thinking all is lost
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done

<b>Chorus:</b>

Count your blessings
Name them one by one
Count your blessings
See what God hath done
Count your blessings
Name them one by one
Count your many blessings
See what God hath done

Are you ever burdened
With a load of care
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear
Count your many blessings
Every doubt will fly
And you will be singing
As the days go by

<b>Verse 3</b>

When you look at others
With their lands and gold
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold
Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven
Nor your home on high

<b>Verse 4</b>

So amid the conflict
Whether great or small
Do not be discouraged
God is over all
Count your many blessings
Angels will attend
Help and comfort give you
To your journey's end

<h3>16. Day by Day (Blott En Dag)</h3> <p> By Andrew L. Skoog ,Karolina Wilhelmina Sandell-Berg, Oskar Ahnfelt</p>
<p><pre>
Day by day, and with each passing moment,
Strength I find, to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.
He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure
Gives unto each day what He deems best—
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He Whose Name is Counselor and Pow’r.
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,”

This the pledge to me He made.
Help me then in every tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E’er to take, as from a father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.

So firm on His promise I'll stand
