Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before
O my soul
I''ll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up, it''s a new day dawning
It''s time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

You''re rich in love, and You''re slow to anger
Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

And can it be that I should gain
An int''rest in the Savior''s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me?

<b>Refrain:</b>
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me!

''Tis mystery all! Th''Immortal dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine!
''Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

He left His Father''s throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam''s helpless race;
''Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature''s night;
Thine eye diffused a quick''ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee. 

<b><i>[Refrain]</i></b>

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th''eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee.
You alone are my heart''s desire
And I long to worship Thee.

You alone are my strength, my shield,
To You alone may my spirit yield.

So much more than anything. <i> [Refrain]</i>

I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye. <i> [Refrain]</i>

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;
Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;
Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

High King of Heaven, my victory won,
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong , a pefect plea:
A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

My name is graven on his hands,
My name is written on his heart;
I know that while in heaven he stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look, and see him there 
Who made an end of all my sin.

Because a sinless Saviour died ,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God , the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  Praise the One, 
Risen Song of God!

Bind us together, Lord

With cords that cannot be broken
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together
Bind us together with love

There is only one God
There is only one King
There is only one Body
That is why we sing

Made for the glory of God
Purchased by His precious Son
Born with the right to be clean
For Jesus the victory has won

You are the family of God
You are the promise divine
You are God''s chosen desire
You are the glorious new wine

Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful 
Where Your streams of abundance flow 
Blessed be Your name 
And blessed be Your name when I''m found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness 
Blessed be your name 

Every blessing You pour out I''ll turn back to praise 
And when the darkness closes in Lord 
Still I will say 

Blessed be the name of the Lord 
Blessed be Your name 
Blessed be the name of the Lord 
Blessed be Your glorious name 

Blessed be Your name when the sun''s shining down on me 
When the world''s “all as it should be” 
Blessed be Your name 
And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering 
Though there''s pain in the offering 
Blessed be Your name 

You give and take away 
You give and take away 
My heart will choose to say 
Lord, blessed be Your name

Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father’s throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts, and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

Breathe on me breath of God
My spirit yearns for You
Hide me in Your fathering arms
Fill up my longing soul

Flood over me like a river my God
Immerse me in Your living stream
Awaken the song that You placed in my heart
Spirit breathe on me
Spirit breathe on me

Breathe on me breath of God
Burn bright eternal fire
Father draw me near to Your heart
You are my one desire

Let no one caught in sin remain
Inside the lie of inward shame
But fix our eyes upon the cross
And run to Him who showed great love
And bled for us
Freely You''ve bled for us

<b>Chorus:</b>
Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave

Beneath the weight of all our sin
You bowed to none but heaven''s will
No scheme of hell, no scoffer''s crown
No burden great can hold You down
In strength You reign
Forever let Your church proclaim

<b><i>(Chorus)</i></b>

O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
The glory of God has defeated the night

O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
Our God is not dead
He''s alive! He''s alive!

Rise up from the grave

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus'' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame

Christ alone
Cornerstone 
Weak made strong 
In the Savior''s love 
Through the storm 
He is Lord 
Lord of all 

When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne
